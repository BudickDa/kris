# Kris (WIP)
**Kris is a personal assistant that answers LinkedIn and Xing messages for you.
He is specialised on spam detection and is trained to raise red flags on "spamy" offers.**

LinkeIn and Xing do not have an API to access messages (which is really embarrassing for them), so the assistant moved to a chrome extension.
@Xing: appending a random value to classes is stupid, stop it! Do you really think this stops anyone from crawling?

Some red flags:
* Headhunter who don't know the difference between Java and JavaScript.
* Headhunter who send the same offer to different people.
* Headhunter who send the same offer to you twice.
* Different headhunter who send you the same offer.
* Headhunter who want your Profile/CV/Resume as a Word-Document (they promise the won't change anything and removing your contact data does not count as change it is a removal!).
* Skills do not match

If you have your own red flags, please send them to kris@budick.eu.
If you have spam or "spamy" messages that are spam or "spamy" for everyone, please sent those also, I need moar trainings data.

Kris will answer those red flagged messages accordingly to encourage the headhunter to self-improve.
(which sadly is necessary; most headhunters are really bad at their job!)

For questions and angry complains write an email to: kris@budick.eu
